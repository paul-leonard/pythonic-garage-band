## Release Info

## Overview
This python script uses Object Oriented Programming methodoliges to structure a fictional band using classes and objects to layout the structure and composition of the band and their talents.

## Architecture
A base (or super) class of Musician is used to create classes of Guitarist, Drummer, and Bassist.  The created object instances can then be added to a band.  Bands are objects created by the class Band.  Various attributes and methods are available for each class including names, instruments, and a textual respresentation of their solos.
